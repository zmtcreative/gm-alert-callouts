## Breaking Changes

> [!WARNING]
>
> **The changes in this release are significant.** While every attempt has been made to create wrappers
> and helpers to keep things running smoothly over previous releases, there is a very real chance some things
> that worked for you in previous versions might work differently or not at all. Please test thoroughly!

## Features

- **GitHub Alerts**: Full support for GitHub's five standard alert types (`[!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, `[!IMPORTANT]`, `[!WARNING]`, `[!CAUTION]`)
- **Obsidian Callouts**: Compatible with Obsidian-style callouts including folding (`+` for open, `-` for closed)
- **Customizable Icons**: Support for custom icon maps
- **Built-in IconSets**: Built-in icon sets Strict GFM alerts (just the five standard GFM Alerts), Hybrid (GFM, Alias and Obsidian-like Callouts) and Strict Obsidian callouts
- **Structured HTML**: Generates semantic HTML with CSS classes for easy styling
- **Nested Content**: Supports complex content including lists, code blocks, and other Markdown elements within alerts
- **Unicode Support**: You can name your custom alerts using Unicode characters (*experimental*) and create custom iconsets using kinds and aliases that use Unicode letters and numbers

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/zmtcreative/gm-alert-callouts
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "bytes"
    "fmt"

    "github.com/yuin/goldmark"
    alertcallouts "github.com/zmtcreative/gm-alert-callouts"
)

func main() {
    // Create Goldmark with the extension using built-in GFM icons
    md := goldmark.New(
        goldmark.WithExtensions(
            alertcallouts.NewAlertCallouts(
                alertcallouts.UseGFMStrictIcons(),
                alertcallouts.WithFolding(true),
            ),
        ),
    )

    source := `# Example
> [!NOTE]
> This is a note with an icon.

> [!WARNING]-
> This is a closed warning callout.`

    var buf bytes.Buffer
    if err := md.Convert([]byte(source), &buf); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Println(buf.String())
}
```

### Pre-configured Extension

For convenience, a pre-configured extension is available:

```go
import (
    "github.com/yuin/goldmark"
    "github.com/yuin/goldmark/extension"
    alertcallouts "github.com/zmtcreative/gm-alert-callouts"
)

// Combining with other extensions
md := goldmark.New(
    goldmark.WithExtensions(
        extension.GFM,                 // GitHub Flavored Markdown
        extension.Footnote,            // Footnotes
        alertcallouts.AlertCallouts,   // Alert callouts
    ),
)
```

This pre-configured extension includes:

- GFM + Aliases icon set (adds aliases like `notes` -> `note` and `tips` -> `tip`)
- Folding functionality enabled
- Ready-to-use configuration

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> When adding custom icons and icon sets in `gm-alert-callouts` you are **only** inserting the icon
> code into the HTML output. You still need to create the necessary CSS styling to format the final
> alert/callout style. An example of a CSS style file for the `Hybrid` built-in icon set can be
> found in the `examples/assets/css/alertcallouts-hybrid.css` file. This should provide a starting point
> for customizing the styling for your project.

## Supported Markdown Syntax

### Basic Alerts

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> This is a note alert.

> [!TIP]
> This is a helpful tip.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is important information.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a warning message.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a caution message.
```

### Foldable Callouts

When folding is enabled, use `+` (default open) or `-` (default closed):

```markdown
> [!TIP]+
> This callout is open by default and can be collapsed.

> [!WARNING]-
> This callout is closed by default and can be expanded.
```

### Multi-line Content

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> This alert contains multiple paragraphs.
>
> - List item one
> - List item two
>
> And even code blocks:
> ```go
> fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
> ```
```

## Configuration Options

The extension supports functional options for flexible configuration:

- **Icon Sets**: `UseGFMStrictIcons()`, `UseHybridIcons()`, and `UseObsidianIcons()`
- **Custom Icons**: `WithIcon()`, `WithIcons()`
- **Functionality**:
  - `WithFolding()` (enable/disable collapsible callouts)
  - `WithCustomAlerts()` (enable/disable custom alerts - will use the default `note` or `info` icon for the set)
  - `WithAllowNOICON()` (enable/disable the use of the `noicon-` and `noicon_` prefixes to tag alert names to not display the icon)

For detailed configuration options and examples, see the [API Reference](docs/FEATURES.md#configuration-options).

## HTML Output

The extension generates semantic HTML with CSS classes for styling:

- **Basic alerts**: Uses `<div>` elements with `callout` and `callout-{type}` classes
- **Foldable callouts**: Uses `<details>` and `<summary>` elements for collapsible functionality
- **Structured content**: Separate containers for title, icon, and content areas

For complete HTML structure details and CSS class reference, see the [API Reference](docs/FEATURES.md#html-output-structure).
